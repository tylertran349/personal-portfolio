                <p>I have been fascinated by technology since seventh grade. I used to spend my free time doing things
                    like watching PC component review videos, overclocking my CPU and graphics card, and building 
                    computers on occasion. The most ambitious thing I have done is flash a modded VBIOS (BIOS of a 
                    graphics card) to bypass the overclocking and voltage limits set by the manufacturer of my 
                    graphics card.

                    In middle school, I took classes at my local library that covered the basics of languages like
                    Python, Java, and HTML. The first time I went in-depth into a programming language was my senior year of
                    high school when I took <i>AP Computer Science A</i>, in which I learned intermediate Java concepts and
                    essential computer science topics. Then, in August 2022, I started doing <i>The Odin Project</i>, a self-guided
                    full-stack web development curriculum, in which I learned various full-stack web development languages, tools, and concepts
                    and created 15+ projects. I love full-stack web development
                    because it allows me to use my artistic ability, creativity, and problem-solving ability to make
                    real-world websites and apps.

                <p>In my free time, I like to keep up with all things NFL, listen to NFL-related podcasts, learn
                    about geography, travel to new places, do go-karting, and play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
